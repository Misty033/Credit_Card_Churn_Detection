# Credit Card Churn Detection

This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict customer churn based on credit card usage patterns. It includes model training, evaluation, and a deployed application with both FastAPI and Streamlit interfaces. The solution is fully containerized using Docker and deployable on **GCP Cloud Run** using Docker images from Docker Hub.

## Key Features

- **0.89 Macro F1 Score** on test data for churn prediction  
- **End-to-End ML Pipeline**: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation  
- **Streamlit Frontend**: Interactive UI for CSV file predictions  
- **FastAPI Backend**: Lightweight REST API for batch prediction  
- **Dockerized**: Easily portable and reproducible environments  
- **Deployed on GCP Cloud Run**: Live application hosted in the cloud  

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python  
- **ML Frameworks**: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy  
- **Web App**: Streamlit  
- **API**: FastAPI  
- **DevOps**: Docker, Docker Compose, Git, GCP Cloud Run  
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
